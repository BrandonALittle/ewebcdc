        Eugene CDC offers healthy and nutritionally balanced meals throughout the day.  With an in-house cook, the Center provides a full breakfast, lunch and afternoon snack, all included in the standard tuition cost.  The Center meets all USDA standards on nutritional guidelines.

        In addition to the Center's exceptional care program, we provide several curriculum enhancement programs throughout the year.  These programs include language and cultural classes, music and instrument instruction, gymnastics, swimming lessons, and art.  The Center also collaborates with community partners on an ongoing basis to offer guest speakers and educational opportunities on good citizenship.

        We have playground areas for every age group and use them several times a day. We also go out for walks rain or shine (including the infants!). You may have seen our groups around town with our shiny nametags pinned to our rain coats.
