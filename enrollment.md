    EWEB CDC maintains a wait list and enrolls new children on a rolling basis. Priority is given to families with a child currently enrolled in the center, and then we open it up for community members. We have an extensive waiting list, especially for the younger ages. If you are interested in joining our community, please let us know and we'd be happy to set up a tour.

        Parents interested in getting on our waitlist should call the center to set up a tour and to meet with the Director. Tours are typically scheduled for 9:00am to give you the best "snapshot" of our program. If that time doesn't work for you, please let us know and we would be happy to arrange a tour at a time that best meets your needs.

        <p>
        If you would like to add your child's name to the wait list following your tour, you will be required to pay a one-time, non-refundable fee of $50. We can accept a check made out to EWEB CDC or cash in exact change.ï»¿
        </p>
        <p>
        You will remain on the wait list until you are offered a spot in the program, or until you let us know that you would like to be removed.
        </p>
        <p>
        When a spot becomes available for a particular classroom, we begin contacting the names on our waiting list. Calls are first made to EWEB employees, then to parents with a child currently enrolled. We then contact families in order of the date the wait list application was completed and the fee was received. Families with a child on the wait list are given 24 hours to accept or turn down the spot offered. If you defer, your name will remain on the wait list.
        </p>
        <p>
        If your child "ages out" of a classroom while on the wait list, we will move his or her name to the next classroom's list.
        </p>
        <p>
        Families on the wait list are welcome to call at any time to check their child's progress towards enrollment.
