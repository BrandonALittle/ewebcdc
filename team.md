    <p>
    Our staff is carefully selected for their background in early childhood development and education. All of our teaching staff have a related degree or extensive experience in the field. A warm approach to caring for the needs of our students is what sets us apart. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Consistent staff with a very low-turnover is another one of the hallmarks of our center. A large portion of our teachers have worked at the center for between ten and twenty years. 
    </p>
    <p>
    We also have low child-to-teacher ratios, ensuring our students receive plenty of individual attention throughout the day. Human bonding and loving attention are critical to the development of a child's self-concept. Recognizing these significant qualities, EWEB CDC takes steps to ensure staff stability and continuity of care.

        The infant program provides lots of cuddling, personal attention, and quiet play time appropriate for the babies.  We maintain a low teacher-child ratio (1:3) to provide opportunities for bonding between infants and care givers, meet each child's physical needs, and prevent over-stimulation.  Babies are allowed the freedom to explore without confining equipment such as swings, highchairs or walkers.  Instead, babies are held or put on the carpet to wiggle, roll and exercise their bodies.

        The toddler program (ages 17 months to 30 months) incorporates numerous group activities for children to develop social and emotional skills.  Circle time, which includes stories read by the teacher and group singing, is a very important part of the toddler's day.  Daily walks give children the opportunity to learn how to cooperate in a group with teachers and explore nature and the neighborhood around the Center.

        The preschool atmosphere is nurturing, flexible, and respectful.  Children have many opportunities to be social as well as the freedom to choose their own activities.  The classroom is carefully designed to provide a variety of challenging and creative learning experiences.  We believe play is central to young children's learning and the classroom is carefully organized to keep children involved and challenged.

        This program provides a unique learning environment for ages 4-6 years.  The focus is on choosing age appropriate activities that are challenging and will help the children be excited about learning. To help children prepare for kindergarten the class is divided into small groups with each lead teacher to work on math, literacy, writing, and other skills. Children who are Kindergarten age (age 5 by September 1) are provided a special kindergarten curriculum each afternoon that aligns with common core standards.
