EWEB CDC will move into our new building on 888 Goodpasture Island Road at the beginning of summer, though the actual date is still to be determined. There is a lot of work to be done between now and then and we encourage you to come talk to the Admin Team or the Board Members to find out more.

<p>
We will be adding a Wobbler Room for older infants-younger toddlers, and a  Before & After School Program for school age kids from the local neighborhood elementary schools.  We will also be adding Summer Camps! Expect the spots to fill up fast.

<p>
The new site has a kitchen and we will continue to provide delicious in-house meals for our children. The playground is huge! It's a beautiful, well-fenced space with brand new playground equipment overlooking the north-end beginnings of the Delta Ponds. There is plenty of parking for drop-offs and pick-ups.

This is a great opportunity to re-brand our center with complete independence and to enhance our vision and mission in a way that keeps us a quality, well-respected program.  We are excited!  We hope you are, too.

    <b>Open spots are available for late Spring 2018!</b>
